🛡️ Viking Fitness – AI-Powered Telegram Workout Coach ⚔️💪

Viking Fitness is an automated, AI-driven workout assistant that delivers personalized 20-minute calisthenics routines directly on Telegram. Built using n8n, OpenAI/Local LLM, and Google Sheets, this system transforms simple workout requests into actionable fitness plans — automatically, instantly, and with the spirit of a Viking warrior.

🚀 What This Project Does

The bot asks the user daily at 8 PM if they’re ready to train. The user simply types a body part (e.g., Biceps, Chest, Legs, Abs) and the AI returns a crisp, non-beginner, equipment-free workout routine. Every activity is logged into Google Sheets with timestamp, workout type, and AI-generated plan.
Version 2 includes a Streak Tracker to keep users accountable and boost consistency.
